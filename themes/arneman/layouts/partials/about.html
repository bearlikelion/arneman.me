            <p>
                I'm a full-stack developer and independent game developer with a passion for creating engaging experiences.
                I specialize in building modern web applications and crafting immersive games that players love.
            </p>
            <p>
                With expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I bring ideas to life through clean code
                and thoughtful design. From developing commercial games on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dev/bearlikelion" target="_blank">Steam</a> to building robust web services,
                I thrive on solving complex problems and learning new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new game mechanics, contributing to open-source projects,
                or experimenting with self-hosted infrastructure.
            </p>
