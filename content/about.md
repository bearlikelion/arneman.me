I'm a full-stack web and game developer. I've shipped two games on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/dev/bearlikelion), built custom modifications to the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), and developed analytics tools that track gameplay balance and retention for over 120,000 players.

When I'm not making games, I'm building web applications with the [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/), automating workflows, and managing cloud infrastructure to keep systems fast and reliable.

I love diving into new technologies, experimenting with side projects, and running my own self-hosted applications.
